Mobile application to provide step by step picture guides to for shortcuts around NUS.

The initial idea for the Project is to provide step by step pictorial instructions to shortcuts around NUS, hence the name NUShortcuts.

The Problem:

Time is wasted travelling around NUS
There are no working NUS shuttle bus navigation apps
We spend lots of time travelling around the campus on a daily basis. I'm sure nobody likes to do that, walking under the scorching sun, squeezing on the bus and all that. So since we're going to take those routes so often, why not learn the shortcuts around NUS to save you time (waiting for buses) and energy (climbing stairs). So here's our solution.

Our Solution:

We plan to build out very own internal NUS navigation app, featuring shortcuts around major points in NUS, with full photo guides and a working shuttle bus estimates.

Features:

Navigation Shortcuts
  Route types (Core)
    Fastest Route
    Sheltered route
    Least Stairs
  Snapchat style photo guides (Awesome to have)
Working Bus estimates (Awesome to have)
  Integrated bus timings (if possible)
